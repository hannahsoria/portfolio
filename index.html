        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am an artist, designer, and master’s student at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a degree in Creative Technology and Design at the ATLAS Institute. My work spans the intersection of art, design, and technology to create innovative works in response to the surrounding world and develop solutions to complex problems using empathetic design. 

          I am also passionate about responsible and ethical computing and design to ensure safety, accessibility, and representation. I uphold this though being apart of the Responsible Computing Challenge Alumni Council supported by Mozilla Foundation and Mellon Foundation. I hold a BA in Computer Science and Studio Art, with a printmaking focus, from Colby College where I developed a strong foundation in technical and creative problem-solving.

              Concert visuals for Fred Again for his album Actual Life 3. I chose this project because I love music and concerts and this artist. The goal was to create two screens: the concert visuals that a viewer would see, and the control panel that someone hidden from the crowd would use. I wanted a highly interactive set up so the control panel has buttons and sliders to control visuals. I also wanted the visuals to interact with the music so I used frequencies, amplitude, and waveform to dictate the movement of the visuals. Lastly, I wanted the visuals to be able to integrate into each other so you can set one visual, background, and text at a time creating a bunch of combinations.

              This is a clever and fun visualization of data that corresponding to the show so that anyone who has seen the show can appreciate the visuals - as the drawing is of Medellín. I also wanted to display multiple data aspects to the show: runtime of episodes and rating of episodes and see if maybe there was a correspondance. The ratings for each episode are the points in the mountains and the runtime for each episode is the height of the building.
